  bio: Yes, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger,
    fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick
    to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it
    dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.
